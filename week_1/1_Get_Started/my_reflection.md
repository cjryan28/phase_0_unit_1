## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

The resources were helpful in setting up git and GitHub. I learned the command line code to use git, and I saw their effects in GitHub. I was able to follow the instructions, but I am having trouble visualizing what exactly is happening when I type in each line of code instructions.

Git is a software tool that allows users to impelment version control. Git allows users to update and track changes made to files locally on their computer. GitHub is an application that allows multiple users to collaborate on projects. When users make changes to files on their computer using Git, they can then upload those changes to GitHub where the changes are merged into source files so that other users can view the most up to date source files.

Version control is an ability to track the evolution of a file from its inception to completion. When a change is made to a file, version control software, like Git, updates the source file, tracks who made the change, and what the change was. Version control software provides a history of a file by capturing the activity that created athe file in a log. GitHub helps with version control on projects requiring more than one user. When work is divisible but still interdependent, GitHub allows users to collaborate, while tracking changes, and publishing most up to date source documents.

Developers use version control to work most efficiently. Using version control, developers can divide tasks and edit files by version.

I am comfortable with the idea of Git and GitHub, but I am shaky on the processes used to make them work.
