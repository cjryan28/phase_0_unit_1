## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository, visit your homepage on GitHub. Under the Repositories tab, there is an option to create a new repository. After clicking, the site brings you to a page where you can name your repository, add a description, choose public or private, and initialize by adding a license. Once the repository is created it will be listed on your homepage under contributions. To clone the repository to your local computer, download the GitHub application, search for the repository under your GitHub.com username, and click clone to computer.

Open source describes a platform whose source code can be edited. Open source platforms are customizeable. 

I think open source is productive. Since we are undoubtedly in the earliest stages of personal computing, I think open source ensures that anyone who can be working on something, can be working on something or making something better. It only makes me nervous that open sourcing seems less secure since it allows users to look at how it runs.

Licensing is important, because each line of code has the ability to create something usable. Licenses explain to users how they can use a creator's materials. I thought it was interesting, too, that the default status of created material is copywritten in the United States. That makes it even more important for creator's to license their materials, if they want others to use them.

The idea of repositories tie Git and GitHub together much better for me. I now understand the vehicle that merges files on your computer to files on GitHub.
