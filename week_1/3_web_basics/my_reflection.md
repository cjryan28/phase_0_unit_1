I learned that programmers use different languages to accomplish different goals. If a website is static, it will use HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript, while if a website is dynamic, it will also use some sort of language like Ruby. I also learned that domain names exist, because they are more easily remembered than IP adresses. Computers communicate with eachother through IP addresses and domain name servers. 

When setting up an HTML site, it's important to remember to use GitHub to check changes, add descriptions, and commit changes. 

It was exciting to see a webpage live. 

I think I'm starting to understand how directories need to be structured so that a webpage references the correct material.
