* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

HTML markup language makes intuitive sense to me with the tagged format. Resources like w3shools.com is a site that helped me understand all the possible tags that exist in a quick way. Adding external CSS formatting was a bit more difficult for me. I have a hunch I am not saving the CSS files in the correct place or at least not referencing it correctly, because I can't seem to make the CSS edits to the webpage. I will write that down and make sure to ask someone soon!

HTML seems good in so far as its ability to build the skeleton of a webpage. HTML provides the foundation for the content of a webpage, but it also seems a little limiting. While I'm sure the language saves developer's time, I feel like the language creates constraints. For instance, if I wanted a circular table to be a part of my webpage, HTML would incentivize me to settle for a rectangular table. 

When I formatted my HTML code at first, it was difficult for me to understand when one tag started and another ended. I had an 'aha' moment when I reformatted the code so that the tags stood out in a nested format. When I did that, it became so much clearer to me exactly what was happening.
