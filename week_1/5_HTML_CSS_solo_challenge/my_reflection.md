At first I thought the links provided were sufficient enough for me to develop my own website. After more than a few hours of frustration, I realized I didn't know the answers to simple questions like what does relative positioning mean and why is that box of text moving that way? I would change something in the CSS document that had a completely different effect on my website than I had imagined. Eventually, I figured it would be productive, and ultimately more efficient if I found more resources to guide me through basic HTML and CSS information. I came across W3schools.com, which was great to introduce me to tags. Still, though, I was not understanding how certain syntax would transalte into the webpage I wanted. I decided I needed to search for something that would show me, so I headed to YouTube. A channel called Programmers Creed had a series of 47 videos that explained HTML and CSS to beginners. I watched at least a third of them, especially on the ones that covered information I didn't understand. I get it so much more now.

It seems remedial, but I was not understanding the idea of blocks or boxes. I didn't understand, for the longest time, how to make things inline with eachother, which I now understand. 

I like the idea of wiping all preformatted margins and padding from the document and inputting your own for each div. I think that makes a lot of sense.

My website for this challenge is bad. To be honest, I want to start from a new clean slate, so I'm leaving this as it is. 

I enjoyed seeing results, that I was actually creating something.

I thought that the process of updating the files, then submitting each incremental change to GitHub, then refreshing my site was tedious. However, I imagine once I get better, my changes will be more in depth and less incremental. Then I'm sure I'll appreciate the process.
