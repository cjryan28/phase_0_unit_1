## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Design and user experience seem to be less vital to a functional website but perhaps more vital to a successful website. Design and user experience, from the materials I read, seem to be investments. They will cost more money or take more time, but the goal is to ultimately be rewarded by having more engaged users. I like the idea of design thinking. I've never seen thought processes broken down into sciences, humanities, and design, but the distinction makes a lot of sense to me. I found myself labeling the type of mindset my friends had. I relate a lot to the design mindset. I think the design mindset is similar to an entreprenurial mindset, which I think I have, though I've never started my own business. I like the idea of what could or what will be more than thinking about what has been or how to fix this. Solution based thinking is messy, which I don't like, but also more valuable. 

One of the resources mentioned Wirify, which is what I bookmarked to use for the challenge. I think sometimes I get stuck looking at text and not realizing its part of one paragraph, which makes it hard for me to visualize the wireframe by myself. Wirify proved useful. I do think the idea of wireframing and blocking a website to be tedious, especially since HTML uses the box model. Without a preframing tool, the web developer could spend lots of time counting pixels to establish a coherent site. On the other hand, I think the idea of being able to create anything, within a pixel, awesome. I get how wireframing is an important part of the development process, to be sure. It's a great transition from nothingness to code. It gives a project more direction.
