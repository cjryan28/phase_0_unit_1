# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model is still a little confusing to me. From what I gather, it's a resource that interprets websites into a readible, real-time, and editable format. To me, it seems like a reverse browser. It's good because there are add ons like pagespeed that allow developers to maximize their website's efficiency. At the same time, with its built in functionality, developers can tweak changes to the site, while it's live. It seems bad, at least at first, because it is not the most intuitive tool. With so much going on, there's a lot to explore.

I wasn't sure which wordpress site to compare to, so I googled which sites are the best. I see similar structures between the sites HTML in the elements tab. Overall the wordpress.com sites had more in depth HTML, but it's easy to pick out the HTML5 tags. Compared to my blog, however, these websites all include complicated CSS and links to JavaScript. 

I thought Chrome Web Tools is convenient. It automatically pops up split screen and lets me play with the website's structure right away. I think that it's a fantastic tool to be able to explore with and learn how people translate their ideas into websites. It is a little overwhelming with where my skills are right now, but it's definitely something I hope to use more of.

I think I'm still working on understanding all the connections that go into a website. But, I think it was big when I was learning about the network tab. I now realize that its the HTML page whicch is a foundation for the site. Through that document all other things are called like javascript or other applications.
