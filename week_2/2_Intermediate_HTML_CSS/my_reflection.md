# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards are good things, in my opinion. I think that they help users understand source code in the most efficient manner. I also think that they help general website users from feeling like their favorite sites are so different from one another. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the different types of websites. I think web standards help minimize the learning curve needed to surf.

I think HTML structure makes a lot of sense to me. It seems navagation and content oriented, which are the two biggest things I do on the Internet. I surf from site to site via navigation and I watch, read or contribute via content. 

I like the HTML5 elements, but it is still a bit tough for me to understand if nav should be imbedded in header and if so, how to go about that and where to position it. Right now nav seems anchorless to me, like it could go about anywhere on the page towards the top.

Reset.css is necessary so that a developers code can look consistent across browsers. Each browser comes with a default stylesheet that if not reset to blank can alter the way a developer would like his site to look. Since each browser has differing stylesheets, a website can not only look different than a developer would like it to, but it may also look differently across browsers. 

I use Google Chrome. I used to use Safari and Firefox. I have never used two browsers on one website at the same time. I'd imagine it throws users for a loop when they go to the same website url but see different websites. 

Duke Greene posted excellent resources in the Google Community about reset.css that helped me understand it clearly.
