# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is design that act appropriately to the browser through which a user is viewing. Responsive web design caters to users by ensuring maximum user capability depending on the users browser size. A responsive website may look different on a computer than on an iPad than on a mobile phone. I think it's a fantastic practice. I use my phone for most internet activities, and it's frustrating when a website isn't compatible. 

I think smartphones and have tablets changed web design, because web design has to react to new user experiences on smaller browsing platforms. Web design has to become much less static and more fluid; the same content needs to be viewed on a multitude of browsers. Browser size may continue to change in the future. Google Glass, for example, shrinks the size completely. 

I would imagine visually impaired people try to use the web similarly to non visually impaired people. Design seems especially important for them, because if it is more difficult to see or read things, the site should be designed intuitively so that they can use it without needing to understand it completely.

I understand the specific elements to change a website from static to fluid. Instead of pixels use percentages or ems. It's difficult for me to understand completely when to use one or the other and also certain conversion ratios. 

I think the website listed to ensure that we can emulate different views of websites is outdated. This one helped me understand what to do; it's a much more current article: http://www.technipages.com/google-chrome-change-user-agent-string. This is really neat resource to check web compatability.
