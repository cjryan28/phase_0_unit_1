# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://cjryan28.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think I enjoyed that a lot more than I thought I would. Designing a site was fun and challenging. There was a lot to think about spatially, that it was really important to have a process. I think any sort of wireframing activity is important. The wireframing gives the developer guidance and a skeleton to begin the structure of his site. No matter if the specifics of my wireframe were correct or usable, I had a design idea that I knew how to fill in and tinker with at worst. Wireframing had me thinking how I wanted to use floats and dimensions to make my website responsive. 

I liked adding more color to the site. My cultural and technical blogs are pretty bland. I was focusing more on the structure than anything else. It was nice to come up with a vision and carry it through. I feel like it gave my website more purpose than just completing the assignment. I didn't like not being able to do everything I wanted. I would spend some time googling and end up remembering the last comment in the directions, "remember your time constraints". At least I have a list for what I want to work on. 

I want my background images to be more translucent. I settled for highlighting my text in white, but I would prefer to see the complete background image. I know there's a way to do that with the ::after psuedo class and absolute and relative positioning, but I couldn't after spending time on it. I also want the background image of my section to move when the user scrolls. With my floating pictures or quotes within the main section, I would like to center them vertically. It was more difficult than wrapping them in a div and vertically aligning each. Come to think of it, maybe if I wrap them in a div and set the elements margin top and bottom to auto, that may work... for another day. 

It hasn't been too hard to apply the material I've learned. I'm still a little shaky on measuring in ems and %, but from wireframing I understand the proportions I want between each element, so once I found a size that worked for one element, it was easy for me to calculate the size I wanted for other elements.
