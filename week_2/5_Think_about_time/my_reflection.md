# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

The first week of Phase 0 I had to ask for an extension because it was the week I had finals and graduated from college. The week was a whirlwind, but I got caught up half way through the second week. During the second week and half way through the third week, I'll be studying for my last CPA exam. It's important that I pass the test, but it's also important for me to stay on task with DBC. I've been pretty motivated with both, so it hasn't been too big of a problem. I spend full days studying, probably more than I have since high school, but it's a short-term arrangement and manageable. My family has been great and supportive. 

I try to stay organized. If I allocate my time properly between CPA and DBC, I can get everything done. Normally after I wake up I do CPA studying, then after lunch I do DBC work. Finally, after dinner I wrap up my night with CPA studying. I seem to be in the flow of things when I work on DBC, because it's all new and interesting stuff to me. I have study materials for the CPA that keeps me on task and a schedule I'm following.

I do a yoga tape almost every other night now that I'm back home. My mom is big into it, and its yoga for stress relief. I feel like it really helps. This may sound strange, but I also make sure to eat healthy. When I eat healthy, my energy, productivity, and focus are way stronger than when I don't eat healthy. I think the last thing I do is take breaks. Normally if my Mom or sister want to talk, I'll take a natural break- that way my most important relationships don't suffer because of my schedule. And they normally make me laugh, which I welcome, because coding and accounting aren't the funniest things.

After my test next week, Phase 0 should be completely manageable. I normally spend 2 to 3 hours on DBC things a day, depending on the work I want to submit. When I'm not studying for the CPA, I can see myself spending an extra hour or 2 on DBC work and feeling very comfortable with the material. I am keeping a list of things I feel I need to revisit to understand completely, so hopefully I'll have some time later next week and for the remainder of Unit One to double back and solidify my understanding.
